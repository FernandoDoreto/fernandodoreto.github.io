## ðŸ“Œ Resources to learn and apply Data Science

* [DeepLearning.AI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/){:target="_blank"} - Offers a range of free courses on AI, Deep Learning, MLOps, NLP, and more. Learn from top instructors and real-world use cases.
* [Google AI Education](https://ai.google/education/){:target="_blank"} - Useful and easy-to-follow courses. I recommend starting with "Intro to ML Problem Framing."
* [StatQuest YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtYLUTtgS3k1Fg4y5tAhLbw){:target="_blank"} - If you really want to understand (and apply) statistics and ML concepts, go there.
* [Cassie Kozyrkov](https://www.youtube.com/c/Kozyrkov/playlists){:target="_blank"} has a set series of videos on "Full Applied AI Lectures" and "Making Friends with Machine Learning". It will definitely improve your vision on AI and ML.
* [Full Stack Deep Learning](https://course.fullstackdeeplearning.com/){:target="_blank"} - Learn about technical aspects, project management, product design, and insights for success in AI systems. Features practical examples from guest speakers.
* Udemy courses from [Soledad G.](https://www.udemy.com/user/soledad-galli/){:target="_blank"}, [Christopher S.](https://www.udemy.com/user/christopher-samiullah/){:target="_blank"}, and [J. Portilla](https://www.udemy.com/user/joseportilla/){:target="_blank"} - Courses from these professionals offer practical foundations for building and deploying machine learning systems. Udemy frequently offers discounts, making these courses affordable. It helps you to understand how to go from Research (Jupyter notebook) to Production.
* There might arrive a moment where you have to show your project's progress/conclusion, or even share an idea/prototype with the team. An interactive web app dashboard comes in hand. If you use Python, you could try [Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/){:target="_blank"} or [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/){:target="_blank"}. If you prefer R, you could try [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/){:target="_blank"}. There are plenty of tutorials/references available on GitHub, YouTube, Stack Overflow etc.
* Data Science leaders on LinkedIn: a way I found useful to keep updated on data science is to connect with / follow data profesionals on LinkedIn. A list of professionals I typically find a lot of inspiration is: [this lady](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kozyrkov/){:target="_blank"}, [this guy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewyng/){:target="_blank"}, [specially this guy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-weber-060397b7/){:target="_blank"}, [this lady](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chiphuyen/){:target="_blank"}, [this lady](https://www.linkedin.com/in/soledad-galli/){:target="_blank"}, [this guy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stevenouri/){:target="_blank"}, [this lady](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dalianaliu/){:target="_blank"} and [this guy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/datawithdanny/){:target="_blank"}.
