## ðŸ“š Personal Projects
<p style="font-size:11px"> <b>NOTE</b>: The apps are deployed in Streamlit Sharing, so <b>boot time</b> might take a few seconds. </p>


* **Machine Learning API**: Once you found an ML model that meets your project's requirements, you will likely deploy an API that will be embedded into an existing software solution. In this project, the [API](https://doreto-ml-api.herokuapp.com/){:target="_blank"} is developed with Django Rest Framework and deployed at Heroku. This dashboard explains the ML Business Case behind the project, and monitors the API's inputs and predictions. [Click here](https://share.streamlit.io/fernandorocha88/portfolio-ml-api/main/app.py){:target="_blank"} 

* **Bike Rental Levels Analytics (Regression and Clustering)**: Let's explore patterns on rental bikes levels based on weather and seasonal information (temperature, working day, season, humidity etc) and predict rental bike levels for a given day, so the Operations team can have more accurate information when reloading bike stations. [Click here](https://share.streamlit.io/fernandorocha88/portfolio-rental-bikes/main/app.py){:target="_blank"} 

* **Customer Churn Analytics (Binary Classification and Clustering)**: We are interested in predicting if a given customer will stop using our services and to cluster the customer base to understand each cluster profile, so that Marketing and Sales can learn more about its customer base segmentation and prevent customer churn.

## ðŸ“Œ Free content recommendation

* [DeepLearning.AI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/){:target="_blank"} - It offers a wide range of incredible (free) courses in AI, Deep Learning, MLOps, NLP and more. Learn awesome use cases with respected instructors/professionals.
* [Google AI Education](https://ai.google/education/){:target="_blank"} - I found the courses very useful and easy to follow. I specially suggest Introd to ML Problem Framing course.
* [StatQuest YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtYLUTtgS3k1Fg4y5tAhLbw){:target="_blank"} - If you really want to understand (and apply) statistics and ML concepts, go there.
* [Cassie Kozyrkov](https://www.youtube.com/c/Kozyrkov/playlists){:target="_blank"} has a set series of videos on "Full Applied AI Lectures" and "Making Friends with Machine Learning". It will definitely improve your vision on AI and ML.
* [Full Stack Deep Learning](https://course.fullstackdeeplearning.com/){:target="_blank"} - It shows not only technical aspects, but also touches project mgt, product design and insights on how to succeed on AI systems. At the end, guest lectures presentations showcase practical examples in the field.
* Udemy courses from [Soledad G.](https://www.udemy.com/user/soledad-galli/){:target="_blank"}, [Christopher S.](https://www.udemy.com/user/christopher-samiullah/){:target="_blank"}, and [J. Portilla](https://www.udemy.com/user/joseportilla/){:target="_blank"} - It's not free of charge, but Udemy offers discounts very often. It gave me the practical foundation for ML systems (create and deploy ML pipeline, unit test, logging, versioning, monitoring), it helps you to understand how to go from Research (Jupyter notebook) to Production.
* There might arrive a moment where you have to show your project's progress/conclusion, or even share an idea/prototype with the team. An interactive web app dashboard comes in hand. If you use Python, you could try [Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/){:target="_blank"} or [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/){:target="_blank"}. If you prefer R, you could try [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/){:target="_blank"}. There are plenty of tutorials/references available on GitHub, YouTube, Stack Overflow etc.
* Data Science leaders on LinkedIn: a way I found useful to keep updated on data science is to connect with / follow data profesionals on LinkedIn. A list of professionals I typically find a lot of inspiration is: [this lady](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kozyrkov/){:target="_blank"}, [this guy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewyng/){:target="_blank"}, [specially this guy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-weber-060397b7/){:target="_blank"}, [this lady](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chiphuyen/){:target="_blank"}, [this lady](https://www.linkedin.com/in/soledad-galli/){:target="_blank"}, [this guy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stevenouri/){:target="_blank"}, [this lady](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dalianaliu/){:target="_blank"} and [this guy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/datawithdanny/){:target="_blank"}.
