Here you're going to find:
> * My latest **personal projects** and
> * Free content recommendation to **learn and apply Data Science**.


Data Science for me is about **combining business experience and technology**. 
* It doesn’t matter if your technology is based on TensorFlow or on multiple Excel spreadsheets, if it’s (1) integrated seamlessly with existing business processes and (2) reveals un-obvious/relevant insights, it has practical value.

### Personal Projects
> * **NOTES**: (1) if requested, both username and password are: **doreto**. (2) Some apps are deployed in free Heroku tier, so **BOOT TIME** might take a few seconds.

### Free content recommendation for Data Science

* [DeepLearning.AI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/) - It offers a wide range of incredible (free) courses in AI, Deep Learning, MLOps, NLP and more. Learn awesome use cases with respected instructors/professionals.
* [Google AI Education](https://ai.google/education/) - I found the courses very useful and easy to follow. I specially suggest Introd to ML Problem Framing course.
* [StatQuest YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtYLUTtgS3k1Fg4y5tAhLbw) - If you really want to understand (and apply) statistics and ML concepts, go there.
* [Cassie Kozyrkov](https://www.youtube.com/c/Kozyrkov/playlists) has a set series of videos on "Full Applied AI Lectures" and "Making Friends with Machine Learning". It will definitely improve your vision on AI and ML.
* [Full Stack Deep Learning](https://course.fullstackdeeplearning.com/) - It shows not only technical aspects, but also touches project mgt, product design and insights on how to succeed on AI systems. At the end, guest lectures presentations showcase practical examples in the field.
* Udemy courses from [Soledad G.](https://www.udemy.com/user/soledad-galli/) [Christopher S.](https://www.udemy.com/user/christopher-samiullah/) and [J. Portilla](https://www.udemy.com/user/joseportilla/) - It's not free of charge, but Udemy offers discounts very often. It gave me the practical foundation for ML systems (create and deploy ML pipeline, unit test, logging, versioning, monitoring), it helps you to understand how to go from Research (Jupyter notebook) to Production.
* This bullet isn't a course recommendation, but more a professional suggestion: there might arrive a moment where you have to show your project's progress/conclusion, or even share an idea with the team. An interactive web app / web dashboard comes in hand. If you use Python, you could try [Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/) or [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/). If you prefer R, you could try [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/). There are plenty of tutorials/references available on GitHub, YouTube, Stack Overflow etc.
* Data Science leaders on LinkedIn: a way I found useful to keep updated on data science is to connect with / follow data profesionals on LinkedIn. A list of professionals I typically find a lot of inspiration is: [this lady](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kozyrkov/), [this guy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewyng/), [specially this guy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-weber-060397b7/), [this lady](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chiphuyen/), [this lady](https://www.linkedin.com/in/soledad-galli/), [this guy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stevenouri/), [this lady](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dalianaliu/) and [this guy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/datawithdanny/).
